    <h2>Why I Believe Bernstein</h2>

I believe the ideology of Marx was incomplete and ill informed. Fundamentally, Marx believed in a “pinnacle” society that could only be attained through the physical implementation of communist theory. He believed that the society he was observing in 1848 was at its boiling point. To Marx, a violent and bloody revolution was an inevitable and unfortunate byproduct of human development. He believed this phase of Hegelian development to be extremely imminent. However, what followed is a divergence from the path that Marx believed to be inevitable. Marx died too early to observe the same shift in human society that thinkers like Eduard Bernstein got to see. Life WAS materially AND morally improving under capitalism. This creates two branches of the “pinnacle” society under the parent ideology of “Socialism”. The first branch is the aforementioned “Communism”. The second is an idealized, hyper-malleable, and equality driven version of capitalism. This is what we now call “Democratic Socialism”. The progenitor of this idea was Eduard Bernstein. I believe that Bernstein noticed something that Marx did not. There was a catch. Humanity, DESPITE its mode of production (aka capitalism), was still improving in a moral sense. This is how I interpret this: We, the proletariat are noticeably less powerful than the ruling class, due to this distance from power the proletariat have become significantly less corrupted by it. In other words, our innate desires have become less twisted by greed because we exist closer to a basic subsistence level. We are simply less excessive than the ruling class. Obviously this sentiment exists on a spectrum, some people exist closer than others to living only at subsistence level. This philosophy leads me to conclude that governments and the ruling class are still materially evil; but the proletariat have not morally degraded as fast. Humanity still exists within the proletariat. This humanity is why we are less inclined towards violence. The wealth gap has grown so staunchly because the proletariat has a moral consciousness that is less corrupted than that of the elite. The elite sees no shame in trampling over his brother in the pursuit of profit. The elite will kill and mangle society in the pursuit of profit. The proletariat is not so cruel. Marx did not expect the proletariat to refrain from violence so long. This refrain has made the proletariat more inclined to work within his systems, his cities, his municipalities, and his ballots. Perhaps Marx would call this fence-sitting garbage. I believe that there is hope for a sort of “Democratic Socialist” pinnacle. This pinnacle exists in the Hegelian dialectical but not in the form of revolution but in the CONSTANT shrinking of the gap between the ruling class and the proletariat. What I argue is admittedly a slow process but it is a process that is less bloody. To let blood mark the dawn of a new ‘era of history’ is to prove that we are not developing vertically, but horizontally. In summary, humanity’s future lies in perfecting democratic socialism in a way that harms the least amount of people. The proletariat, by virtue of historical progression have been acclimated to this path by capitalism itself. This path must mark a new age of moral superiority.

Note 1: I would like to clarify something as I assume many will accuse me of  being too confident in the proletariat: I speak of the proletariat deliberately in a mystical sense. Marx believes that there is a nucleus of misery that is bound to implode thus killing off the capitalist system. I view this in a sort of Aristotelian kind of way. This nucleus is the "essence" of the proletariat. I disagree with Marx because I believe that essence is not moving towards misery. The essence is not a good thing nor a bad thing, it merely is. This is exactly how Aristotle describes his theory of essences. Thus this essence can be molded, it does not HAVE to be misery. The proletariat will falter if it is not meant to be romanticized. I am merely confident that humanity will push the system further towards progress, just as Hegel predicted. I am not meaning to romanticize the proletariat. Instead I am expressing confidence in my system of beliefs.

Note 2: I define the “pinnacle” of a society to be a society that has wholly embraced complete fraternity within itself. It operates under a sort of “harm principle” articulated by John Stuard Mills.</p>
